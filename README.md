**Implementation Overview :**

Signup Page:  
    A signup page has been created to register the user. This user data gets stored in a realtime firebase database. And the user gets authenticated via Firebase authentication. The signup page stores user data like name, email, password.

Login Page:
    A login page has been created to login into the dashboard to get the personal space. The email id and password is stored in firebase real time database. And lets the user in to the main content of the website.

DashBoard: 
    The Dashboard page comes after the user logs in. This is their personal space where they can see various stats like how many persons they have paid, the amount they have paid, and have to pay in the future. It also shows the transaction history and provides the ability to make groups to split payments and calculate the exact amount that each person has to contribute all while having a nice, easy to understand and navigate UI.


**Firebase:**

	FireBase Realtime Database:
	Firebase Realtime Database is used to store the data like Login data, and Registration data of the users in this project. It stores and synchronizes data in real-time. We have created a real time 		database that helps us to speed up the storing data process while providing reliability.


	FireBase User Authentication:
	Firebase User Authentication is used to Authenticate the user when they Login or Register. It stores and synchronizes user authentication data in real-time with Timestamps. We have used this 	authentication to provide a secure and reliable service for our users. It also helps to optimise the login and registration process by providing support for login and registration via services like Google, 	Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.


**Make Group: **
    This is a functionality that allows the user to make a group in which they can invite other people who also bear the expense. In order to make that group, the user has to write the email id’s or the Unique Id’s of the other members. After that, they have to enter the total amount to be paid in the next field. Which will get divided amongst them and the share of each individual will be displayed. They also have the ability to pay right there and there using the integrated payment button

**Technology Stack :**

**Technologies for FrontEnd:**
    HTML ,CSS and JavaScript is the Frontend technologies used by our team to create the FairShare.com website. HTML is the basic building block language used when it comes to developing a frontend of any 	project. CSS is used by our team to make our website attractive and to provide some structure to the overall layout to the webpages. JavaScript is used to make our website dynamic and responsive as well 	as highly interactive.
 
**Technologies for BackEnd:**
    JavaScript is a very versatile language which we have used to implement the backend of FairShare.com.

    The FairShare.com uses Firebase provided by Google as it’s database. It allows real-time database connection, which means multiple users can see the changes in the data when the data gets created or 		edited.It is also very easy to use and provides many cool features that assists the programmer in integration.

Then we wireframes the website and bifurcated it into various pages and their main features. Next step was to choose the optimal technologies to develop the website. After a lots of debating as to which technology was best suited to our website, as mentioned above we decided on HTML, CSS , JavaScript and Firebase as our main technologies.And with that,we started the development of our project.


**Challenges and Solutions:**

--> JavaScript is a very new Technology for us along with Firebase Operations.These two parts of the project took the most amount of our time to implement or to integrate. We used resources like Youtube or Google and also ChatGPT to learn from our mistakes .
We also faced the situation where we have a very short time to complete the work so the time management is also one of the most challengeable part.

--> We wish to introduce FairShare.com to the corporate world after adding a few features in it.We wish for FairShare.com to make people life a bit more easy , a bit more balanced , a bit more stress-free and a bit more fair . 

What other features we wish to implement in FairShare.com ?
--> As mentioned above , for us to introduce the FairShare.com into the corporate world, the website needs to be amended with bit more features that include : 
1>Option to either pay first and then contribute or to contribute first and then pay : Our website at present time allows user to divide the amount paid fairly between all group members.However , there is no option for gathering the funds beforehand and then paying it .This is the feature we would love to add and implement. 
2>Option for user to include varying percentage of share : This feature would allow the payee of the group to set which individual should pay what percentage of the total amount.

We aim to provide a service that not only manage the group finances but in a stress-free and just manner. We hope that this website/app gets on par with top finance services like PhonePe and GooglePay so we can provide this hassle free enjoyable group experience to everybody around the world.
